# INTERVIEW PANEL

### Efficient Interview Management
The console application streamlines the process of managing interviews by enabling panelists to:
- View and schedule interviews
- Review candidate profiles
All these tasks can be performed within a command-line interface, facilitating efficient communication and coordination among panel members without the need for a complex graphical interface.

### Centralized Data Storage
The application serves as a centralized repository for interview-related data, including:
- Candidate information
- Interview schedules
- Panelist feedback
- Hiring decisions
This ensures that all panel members have access to up-to-date information, promoting transparency and consistency in the interview process. Additionally, the console interface simplifies data entry and retrieval, enabling panelists to quickly access relevant information during interviews.
